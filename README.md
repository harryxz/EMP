Event-based stereo matching algorithm

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

The event-based stereo uses event based camera such as DAVIS ATIS.

The input is each event e(ts,x,y,p,l,Gt_d), ts is timestamps, x and y are the image coodrinates of the events,p is the polarity, l is the left/right label(0 is left and 1 is right),Gt_d is the ground truth of disparity.

The output is the disparity value for each event. 

This work is showed detailed in Xie Zhen, Garrick Orchard,"Event-Based Stereo Depth
Estimation Using Belief Propagation" frontiers in Neuroscienceï¼Œ 2017.
